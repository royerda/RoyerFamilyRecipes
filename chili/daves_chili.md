# Dave's Chili Recipe

## Ingredients
  * 2 lbs Ground Beef
    * I generally use 80/20, but I’ve also used 90/10.  Whatever you prefer.
  * 2 cans black beans
  * 2 cans dark red kidney beans
  * 1 Large Onion
    * Doesn’t matter what kind, I generally go for sweet onions, preferably Vidalias.
  * 2 bell peppers
    * Again, your preference here, I normally throw in at least one red, but you can do 2 green, 2 red, a mix of the two, or get colorful and throw in a yellow or orange bell pepper.
  * 1 large can of fire roasted green chilies.
  * 1 large can of diced tomatoes
  * 4 packs of Chili mix
    * Your preference on brand, this is just easier half the time.  I've also been known to make my own mix of chilipowder, cumin, cayenne, and so forth.)
  * 3 packs of (dry) Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix
    * Make sure you don’t get the “Dips” version.
  * 2 Bay leaves 
  * **OPTIONAL:**
    * In lieu of the canned green chilies: 3-4 Anaheim peppers (or Poblano peppers)
    * In lieu of canned tomatoes: 6-8 Roma tomatoes or 4-6 smallish tomatoes on the vine 
    * 3-5 Jalapeno peppers (or more to taste)
    * (ultra optional) Serrano peppers
      * Add if you like some heat, but be careful.  I once threw in about 5 of these, possibly with seeds, and I couldn’t make it through half a bowl of chili it was so spicy!
    * Can/Bottle of beer. Pale ales are generally really good in chili, but I’ve also used Guinness before.
    * Block of Monterey Jack cheese

Onion and peppers should be diced.  All peppers should be cleaned/seeded (in other words, get rid of the seeds, unless you like extra spice in your chili).

## Directions
1. Turn crock pot on high, pour in beans (liquid and all), add the bay leaves, and give it a quick stir.
2. Sweat the onions and peppers in a skillet with a little bit of olive oil and butter.  Once the onion/pepper mix is ready, stir in the fire roasted chilies for a minute or two and dump the whole mixture into the crock pot and stir.
3. Brown and crumble the beef in a pan, add tomatoes and chili mix, (add the optional beer here once the chili seasoning is properly mixed in with the meat), simmer for 10-20 minutes (your preference).  Once this beef, tomato, possibly beer mix has simmered to your liking, dump it into the crock pot and give it a good stir.
4. Add the Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix to the crock pot.  It’s easiest to just do this one pack at a time (pour out pack, stir into chili, repeat).
5. Let the chili cook for around 4 hours, or until the smell has become so overwhelmingly awesome in your home that you just can't stand it anymore.
6. This goes really well with some freshly shredded Monterey Jack cheese on top and some cornbread on the side.

## Notes
  * The chili turns out especially awesome if you cook it all a day in advance in a pot on the stovetop, chill it in the fridge overnight, then reheat either on the stove or in a crock pot for the chili eating occasion. The overnight mingling of all that good stuff makes it all the better :)
  * As it may be obvious, there’s a lot of things in the recipe left to personal preference.  I don’t think I’ve ever made it exactly the same each time, but the general idea is beef, beans, chili peppers, and the ranch dressing mix.  So experiment to your heart’s content.
  * I used to use all fresh produce, but it always ended up taking around 1-1.5 hours to get everything in the crock pot (there was a ridiculous amount of dicing to do!). I have since gone to the canned green chilies and canned tomatoes, and the prep time has dropped significantly.
  * Most of the time I will do steps 2 and 3 at the same time.
