# Modified Vegetarian Chili Recipe

## Ingredients
  * 1 lbs Cubed Beef Stew Meat
  * 2 red bell peppers
  * 1 sweet onion
  * 4 garlic cloves
  * 2 packets of chili mix
  * 1 Tablespoon ground cumin
  * 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
  * 1 teaspoon paprika
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 2 cups vegetable broth/stock
  * 3 Tablespoons olive oil
  * 1.5 cups cubed, peeled butternut squash
    * I just get pre-cubed/peeled butternut squash from the store
  * 1 (15 oz) can each of:
    * pinto beans
    * cannellini beans
    * red kidney beans
  * 1 bunch green onions
  * 1 can diced tomatoes
  * 1 big can crushed peeled tomatoes


## Directions
1. Preheat broiler.
2. Cut bell peppers in half length-wise. Remove and discard seeds and membranes. Place pepper halves, skin sides up, on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil 15 minutes or until blackened (fist attempt took more like 20 minutes). Place pepper halves in a zip-top plastic bag; seal. Let stand 15 minutes. Peel and chop peppers.
3. Season stew meat with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add oil (extra above/beyond the ingredients list, enough for the meat). Add stew meat and sear until browned, about 2 minutes. Remove stew meat to bowl.
5. Lower heat to medium-low. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add onion; cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Stir in seasonings (e.g. cumin, paprika, chili mix, etc...); cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
7. Add bell peppers, broth, squash, and tomatoes; bring to a simmer. Cook 20 minutes stirring occasionally.
8. Add beans; simmer 25 minutes or until slightly thick, stirring occasionally.
9. Sprinkle with green onions.

## Notes
  * This chili recipe originated from a vegetarian chili that was made by Mo (Lawrence Royers' neighbor). The truly *original* recipe apparently turns out a bit too soupy, so I started from an already modified version with some notes from Maureen, then I added stew meat because I wanted some **meat** :).
