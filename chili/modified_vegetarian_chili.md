## Notes
  * This chili recipe originated from a vegetarian chili that was made by Mo (Lawrence Royers' neighbor). The truly *original* recipe apparently turns out a bit too soupy, so I started from an already modified version with some notes from Maureen, then I added stew meat because I wanted some **meat** :).
