# Modified Vegetarian Chili Recipe

## Ingredients
  * 1 lbs Cubed Beef Stew Meat
  * 2 red bell peppers
  * 1 sweet onion
  * 4 garlic cloves
  * 2 cups vegetable broth/stock
  * 1.5 cups cubed, peeled butternut squash
    * I just get pre-cubed/peeled butternut squash from the store
  * 1 (15 oz) can each of:
    * pinto beans
    * cannellini beans
    * red kidney beans
  * 1 bunch green onions
  * 1 can diced tomatoes
  * 1 big can crushed peeled tomatoes
  * 2 packets of chili mix



## Directions
1. Preheat broiler.
2. Cut bell peppers in half length-wise. Remove and discard seeds and membranes. Place pepper halves, skin sides up, on a foil-lined baking sheet. Broil 15 minutes or until blackened (fist attempt took more like 20 minutes). Place pepper halves in a zip-top plastic bag; seal. Let stand 15 minutes. Peel and chop peppers.
3. 

## Notes
  * This chili recipe originated from a vegetarian chili that was made by Mo (Lawrence Royers' neighbor). The truly *original* recipe apparently turns out a bit too soupy, so I started from an already modified version with some notes from Maureen, then I added stew meat because I wanted some **meat** :).
