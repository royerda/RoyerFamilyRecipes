# Pumpkin King
This is a layered pumpkin pie cheesecake inspired by the Pumpkin King dessert we first had at [RPG Lawrence](https://rpglawrence.com/). Final pie is topped with a homemade salted caramel, and a touch of whipped cream does wonders.

## Process Overview
You'll make the pie first and chill that in the fridge overnight. The caramel can be made whenever, though it works fine to make that quickly (takes ~15 minutes or so) just prior to serving the pie.

## Ingredients
This thing is built in 4 parts: the graham cracker crust, the cheesecake, the pumpkin pie/cheesecake, the salted caramel.

### Graham Cracker Crust
  * 6 whole graham crackers
  * 2 1/3 ounces Dark Brown Sugar
  * 2.5 ounces All Purpose Flour
  * Salt
  * 7 Tbsp Unsalted Butter - melted
### Cheesecake
  * 16 oz Full Fat Cream Cheese (x2 8oz packages of Philadelphia Original)
    * at room temperature (bring out of fridge 1-2 hours prior to starting the Directions)
  * 8 oz Granulated Sugar
  * 4 Large Eggs
    * at room temperature
  * 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
### Pumpkin Pie
  * 1 can (15 oz) pumpkin puree
  * 2 large eggs
    * at room temperature
  * 1 cup packed Dark Brown Sugar
  * 2 Tbsp Maple Syrup (the real stuff!)
  * 2 tsp cinnamon
  * 2 tsp ground ginger
  * 1/4 tsp allspice
  * 1/4 tsp ground cloves
  * 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
  * 1 cup heavy whipping cream
  * 1 tsp vanilla extract
### Salted Caramel
  * 200 grams Granulated Sugar
  * 6 Tbsp (90 grams) Salted Butter
    * Room Temperature, cut into 6 pieces
  * 1/2 cup Heavy Whipping Cream, at room temperature
  * 1 tsp sea salt
### Whipped Cream
  * 1 cup heavy whipping cream
  * 2 Tbsp sugar
  * (optional) dash of vanilla extract
## Directions
  1. Preheat oven to 325
  2. Follow Babish for the graham cracker crust (on the cheesecake)
  3. Follow the first link (pumpkin cheesecake bars) for directions on the cheesecake, just use the ingredients amounts above
  4. When the cheesecake ingredients are combined, take a 1/2 cup of the cheesecake filling and put into a separate bowl. Build the Pumpkin Pie filling with that half cup of cheesecake filling. You're gonna mostly follow Babish for this, but you can use a spatula to stir and combine everything as opposed to a food processor.
  5. **Make sure you butter the sides of the pan liberally!!!**
  6. Pour the pumpkin pie filling over the crust.
  7. Pour the cheesecake over the pumpkin pie filling.
    * It's going to seem like you're ruining the layers, but do your best to gently spread the cheesecake around over the top and it'll end up ok.
  8. Bake until the middle is mostly set but maybe a slight bit of jiggle left. First time around took upwards of 45-60 minutes with a detour to 350 then 400 at some point. I haven't quite figured out this step yet.
  9. When ready, follow the salted caramel recipe exactly.
  10. Make some whipped cream by whipping ingredients with an electric mixer, or just buy some whipped cream.

There isn't any recipe around that matches exactly what RPG Lawrence made for the Pumpkin King, so I went and found several recipes to help put this one together. I think the only things I followed exactly were the graham cracker crust from Binging with Babish and the salted caramel recipe.
