# Mint Chocolate Chip Cookies
These things are practically like mint chip ice cream in cookie form. They made for a great St. Paddy's Day baking activity with a 5 year old :)

## Ingredients
  * 1 cup sugar (201 grams)
  * 1/2 cup butter, softened (1 stick)
  * 1 egg
  * 1/2 cup plain yogurt (approximately 123 grams)
    * *DO NOT USE FAT-FREE YOGURT!* See Notes Section about this one.
  * 1 small box instant vanilla pudding mix (3.4 oz)
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1/2 tsp baking soda
  * 2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 3 tsp peppermint extract
  * 3 drops blue coloring + 10-15 drops green coloring
  * 1.5 cups chocolate chips
    * We split this amount between milk chocolate and dark chocolate chips. Baker's choice.

## Directions
  1. Preheat oven to 350.
  2. Combine sugar, butter, egg, and yogurt into large bowl and cream it all together.
  3. Add pudding mix and blue food coloring and mix.
  4. In separate bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda; whisk to combine.
  5. Add peppermint extract, flour mix, and green food coloring. Mix until the cookie dough resembles mint ice cream.
  6. Add chocolate chips, mix to combine.
  7. Bake on parchment paper at 350 for 15-20 minutes.
  8. Let cool on a rack or plate or something before diving in.

### Notes
  * Source link has a quick video at the top of the page to show the steps they took. It's only 1 minute long and worth a quick watch.
  * The ingredients list in there conveniently leaves out the Andes mints that they also added, but the author calls those optional.
  * We skipped the Andes mints just so we didn't need to unwrap a bunch of individual pieces and chop those up. To make sure we got plenty of mint flavor we just added an extra tsp of the peppermint extract.
  * Original recipe calls for generic "mint extract", we went with Peppermint.
  * *About that yogurt.* Original recipe calls for a half cup of sour cream, or yogurt as an alternative. It's the fat from this ingredient that you need for the cookie dough, so with the plain yogurt you really need some milk fat in there. We used Fage 5% plain yogurt.
  * Original calls for an oven at 375, but that seemed to char the bottoms too quickly on the first batch before cooking the rest of the cookie. We then did 350 for more like 15-20 minutes, and that worked pretty well.
