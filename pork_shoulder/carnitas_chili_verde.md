# Carnitas and/or Chili Verde

## Ingredients
  * Pork Shoulder, 3.5-4.5 lbs
    * Bone-in is best, but boneless will do in a pinch
    * See Notes section regarding pork shoulder size options
  * 2 cups Salsa Verde
    * Use your favorite salsa verde, I've had the best luck with Herdez
  * 2 cups chicken stock
  * 1 Large Sweet Onion, chopped
  * 1 Tablespoon Cumin
  * 1 Tablespoon Coriander
  * 1 Teaspoon Dried Oregano

  * For the resulting tacos, get yourself some tortillas, fresh cilantro, and cheese


## Directions
You can use either a pot on the stovetop or a slowcooker. I tend to prefer stovetop as its easier to get the final chili verde sauce that way, but the slow cooker is far easier to setup in the morning and not worry about the pork for the day.

1. Combine all liquid, onion, and seasoning into the pot and turn on the heat (start on high heat for both stovetop and slow cooker).
2. Place whole pork shoulder into the pot
3. Stovetop: bring to boil, reduce heat to low/low-ish, cover. Slow cooker: set heat to low on longest setting.
4. Let cook for 3-4 hours on stovetop, 8-10 hours in slow cooker, until pork shoulder can easily tear apart with a fork.
  * Note: for bigger pork shoulder (e.g. 7.5 lbs) cook longer, something like 5-ish hours on stovetop.
5. Remove pork shoulder, discard the bone, and pull/shred the pork with two forks.
6. With remaining liquid (transfer from slow cooker to pot on the stove if necessary), set heat to high for a rolling boil, reduce like this for approximately 15-20 minutes. See notes in the Source section.
7. To finish the pork and get it a nice crisp finish, you have a couple options:
  * Put the shredded pork into the oven at 350 for about 15-20 minutes
  * OR
  * When you shred up the pork, there should still be a thick layer of fat on the top of the shoulder. Scrape that fat off and place it in a cast iron skiller, render the fat on medium heat, then fry the shredded pork in the rendered pork fat. This will get you carnitas like what we get at taco shops in San Diego.

## Source
  * This carnitas/chili verde recipe originally came from [simplyrecipes.com](http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/salsa_verde_carnitas/)
  * It took me several attempts to get the end chili verde sauce right. I was following the recipe closely, but I wasn't really reducing the sauce nearly enough.
  * The oven step in the recipe is meant to be an easy way to crisp up the pulled pork into something more like carnitas. I think it was also a misguided attempt at making the recipe healthier. Traditional carnitas is actually fried in rendered pork fat, and it wasn't until years after starting to work with the recipe that I realized you could just render the fat from the top of the pork shoulder and fry up some pulled pork in that. Rendering the fat actually wasn't that laborious or time consuming, and it's effing delicious.

## Notes
  * The recipe calls for a 3.5 lb pork shoulder, but I normally find around shoulders that are 4.5 lbs, and some recent batches have been with a 7.5 lb shoulder. If you get more like the 7.5 lb shoulder, make sure you increase the liquid, cooking time (obviously), and double up the seasoning.
  * Recipe calls for cumin seeds and coriander seeds. We didn't like that at all. Just use some ground cumin and ground coriander.
  * Speaking of which, I just use a full Tbsp of each, rather than the 2 tsp in the recipe.
  * I have always used dried oregano. Might be pretty good with fresh, but the dried stuff seems to do the trick.
  * Recipe says 2 cups salsa verde, 3 cups chicken stock. I have found I get a better chili verde sauce with roughly half and half. So for the smaller pork shoulder, 2 cups salsa verde, 2 cups stock. Yesterday was 4 cups each.
  * I have no idea why it specifies 1.5 cups of onion. Just get a big onion, chop it up, and throw it in the pot.
  * I have found it easiest to put the onion, liquid, and seasoning in the pot first, stir it up a bit, then drop the pork in. I'm not sure if this really makes any difference, it's just easier than trying to mix up liquid/seasoning with a big ol' pork shoulder in the middle there.
