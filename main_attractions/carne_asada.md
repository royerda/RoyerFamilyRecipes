# Carne Asada Marinade
This is a simple recipe for a carne asada marinade. It's best on skirt steak, though flank stank would work as well. I've tried a few other marinades from scratch, but this is the only one that's come close to the marinade we used to get from Von's in Rancho Bernardo.

Quantities have been used for 3 lbs of Skirt Steak, so adjust as you see fit.

## Ingredients
  * Juice from 2 Oranges
  * Juice from 2 Limes
  * 4 cloves garlic, minced
  * Small bunch Fresh Cilantro
  * 3 Tablespoons "Chef Merito Steak & Meat Seasoning (Carne Asada & Bistec)"
    * If this isn't available, you can probably get close with the following:
    * Salt
    * Pinch of Sugar
    * Paprika
    * Powdered Garlic
    * Dried Oregano
    * Cumin
    * Powdered Onion
    * Black Pepper
  * 1/2 Cup Soy Sauce
  * 1/2 Cup Olive Oil

## Directions
1. Combine all ingrediants in a bowl and stir to mix
2. Place meat in a big ziploc bag
3. Pour in marinade and mix in amongst the meat
4. Refrigerate overnight

## Notes
  * I'm not exactly sure how long you really need to let the marinade settle, but an overnight stint turns out really tasty!
